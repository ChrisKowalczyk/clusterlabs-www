	All examples assume two nodes that are reachable by their short name and IP address:
	<ul>
	  <li><code>node1 - 192.168.1.1</code></li>
	  <li><code>node2 - 192.168.1.2</code></li>
	</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
	The convention followed is that <strong>[ALL] #</strong>
	denotes a command that needs to be run on all cluster
	machines, and <strong>[ONE] #</strong> indicates a command
	that only needs to be run on one cluster host.
