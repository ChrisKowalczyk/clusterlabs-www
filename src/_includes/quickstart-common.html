	  <p>
	    All examples assume two nodes that are reachable by their short name and IP address:
	    <ul>
	      <li>node1 - 192.168.1.1</li>
	      <li>node2 - 192.168.1.2</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The convention followed is that <strong>[ALL] #</strong>
	    denotes a command that needs to be run on all cluster
	    machines, and <strong>[ONE] #</strong> indicates a command
	    that only needs to be run on one cluster host.
	  </p>
