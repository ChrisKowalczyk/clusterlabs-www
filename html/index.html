	    <p>
	      Pacemaker supports many deployment scenarios, from the simplest 2-node
	      standby cluster to a 16-node active/active configuration.

	      Pacemaker can also dramatically reduce hardware costs by allowing
	      several active/passive clusters to be combined and share a common
	      backup node.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Pacemaker monitors the system for both hardware and software failures.

	      In the event of a failure, Pacemaker will automatically recover your
	      application and make sure it is available from one of the remaning
	      machines in the cluster.

	    <h2>Recover</h2>
	    <a href="img/Recover.20121116.png"><img src="img/Recover-small.20121116.png"></a>
	    <p>
	      After a failure, Pacemaker uses advanced algorithms to quickly
	      determine the optimum locations for services based on relative node
	      preferences and/or requirements to run with other cluster services (we
	      call these "constraints").

	  <h2>FAQ</h2>
	  <p class="question">Q: Where can I get Pacemaker?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker ships as part of most modern
	    distributions, so you can usually just launch your
	    favorite package manager on:
	    <ul>
	      <li>openSUSE and SLES,</li>
	      <li>Fedora and derivatives such as RHEL and CentOS</li>
	      <li>Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu</li>
	      <li>Gentoo</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p class="answer">
	    The project also provides
	    up-to-date <a href="/rpm-next">packages for RHEL5 and
	    RHEL6</a>.  If all else fails, you can try installing
	    from <a href="http://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker">source</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Is there any documentation?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes. You can find the set relevant to
	    your version in our <a href="/doc">documentation
	    index</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Where should I ask questions?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Often basic questions can be answered
	    on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org#linux-cluster">irc</a>,
	    but sending them to the relevant
	    <a href="/wiki/Mailing_lists">mailing list(s)</a> is
	      always a good idea so that everyone can benefit from the
	      answer.  Don't worry if you pick the wrong one, many of
	      us are on multiple lists and someone will suggest a more
	      appropriate list if necessary.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Do I need shared storage?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: No.  We can help manage it if you have
	    some, but Pacemaker itself has no need for shared storage.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Which cluster filesystems does Pacemaker support?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker supports the
	    popular <a href="http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2/">OCFS2</a>
	    and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/gfs/">GFS2</a>
	    filesystems.  As you'd expect, you can use them on top of
	    real disks or network block devices
	    like <a href="http://www.linbit.com/en/products-services/drbd/">DRBD</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: What kind of applications can I manage with Pacemaker?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Pacemaker is application agnostic, meaning
	    anything that can be scripted can be made highly available
	    - provided the script conforms to one of the supported
	    standards:
	    <a href="/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-crmsh/html/Pacemaker_Explained/_linux_standard_base.html">LSB</a>,
	    <a href="/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-crmsh/html/Pacemaker_Explained/s-resource-supported.html#_open_cluster_framework">OCF</a>, 
	    <a href="/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-crmsh/html/Pacemaker_Explained/_systemd.html">Systemd</a>,
	    or <a href="http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-crmsh/html/Pacemaker_Explained/_upstart.html">Upstart</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Can I use Pacemaker with Heartbeat?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes. Pacemaker started off life as part
	  of the Heartbeat project and continues to support it as an
	  alternative to Corosync. See
	  this <a href="http://www.linux-ha.org/wiki/Configuration">documentation</a> for more details</p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Can I use Pacemaker with CMAN?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes. Pacemaker added support for CMAN
	  in version 1.1.5 to better integrate with distros shipping
	  the RHCS cluster stack.  This is particularly relevant for
	  those looking to use GFS2 or OCFS2. See
	  the <a href="http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-plugin/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/ch08s02.html">documentation</a> for more details</p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Can I use Pacemaker with Corosync 1.x?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes. You will need to configure
	  Corosync to load Pacemaker's custom plugin to provide the
	  membership and quorum information we require. See
	  the <a href="http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-plugin/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/s-configure-corosync.html">documentation</a> for more details.</p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Can I use Pacemaker with Corosync 2.x?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes. Pacemaker can obtain the
	  membership and quorum information it requires directly from
	  Corosync in this configuration. See
	  the <a href="http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-pcs/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/_cluster_software_installation.html">documentation</a> for more details.</p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Do I need a fencing device?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Yes.  Fencing is the only 100% reliable
	    way to ensure the integrity of your data and that
	    applications are only active on one host.  Although
	    Pacemaker is technically able to function without Fencing,
	    there are a good reasons SUSE and Red Hat will not support
	    such a configuration.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Do I need to know XML to configure Pacemaker?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: No. Although Pacemaker uses XML as its
	    native configuration format, there
	    exist <a href="#addons">2 CLIs and at least 4 GUIs</a>
	    that present the configuration in a human friendly format.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: How do I synchronize the cluster configuration?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Any changes to Pacemaker's
       	    configuration are automatically replicated to other
       	    machines.  The configuration is also versioned, so any
       	    offline machines will be updated when they return.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: Should I choose pcs or crmsh?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: Arguably the best advice is to use
	    whichever one comes with your distro.  This is the one
	    that will be tailored to that environment, receive regular
	    bugfixes and feature in the documentation.
	  </p>
	  <p class="answer">
	    Of course, for years people have been side-loading all of
	    Pacemaker onto enterprise distros that didn't ship it, so
	    doing the same for just a configuration tool should be
	    easy if your favorite distro does not ship your favorite
	    tool.
	  </p>

	  <p class="question">Q: What if my question isn't here?</p>
	  <p class="answer">A: See the <a href="html.html">getting help</a> section and let us know!</p>

	  <h1>Conifguration Tools</h1>
	  <a id="addons"> </a>
	  <p>
	    Pacemaker's internal configuration format is XML, which is
	    great for machines but terrible for humans.
	    
	    The community's best minds have created GUIs and Shells to
	    hide the XML and allow the configuration to be viewed and
	    updated in a more human friendly format.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Command Line Interfaces (Shells)</h2>
	  <p><a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/crmsh/">crmsh</a>
	    - The original configuration shell for Pacemaker. Written
	    and maintained by SUSE, it may be used either as an
	    interactive shell with tab completion, for single commands
	    directly on the shell's command line or as batch mode
	    scripting tool.

	  <p><a href="https://github.com/feist/pcs">pcs</a> - An
	    alternate vision for a full cluster lifecycle
	    configuration shell and web based GUI. Handles everything
	    from cluster installation through to resource
	    configuration and status.</p>
	  <h2>GUI Tools</h2>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker-mgmt">pygui</a>
	    - The original GUI for Pacemaker written in Python by IBM
	    China.  Mostly deprecated on SLES in favor of Hawk</p>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk">hawk</a> -
	    Hawk is a web-based GUI for managing and monitoring
	    Pacemaker HA clusters. It is generally intended to be run
	    on every node in the cluster, so that you can just point
	    your web browser at any node to access it.  It is
	    documented as part of the
	    <a href="http://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/?page=/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/data/cha_ha_configuration_hawk.html">
	      SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability
	      Extension documentation</a></p>
	  <p><a href="http://lcmc.sf.net">LCMC</a> - The Linux Cluster
	    Management Console (LCMC) is a GUI with an inovative
	    approach for representing the status of and relationships
	    between cluster services.  It uses SSH to let you install,
	    configure and manage clusters from your desktop.</p>

	  <h1>Other Add-ons</h1>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/booth">booth</a>
	    - The Booth cluster ticket manager extends Pacemaker to
	    support geographically distributed clustering.  It does
	    this by managing the granting and revoking of 'tickets'
	    which authorizes one of the cluster sites, potentially
	    located in geographically dispersed locations, to run
	    certain resources.
