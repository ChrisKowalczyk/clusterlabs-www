	  <h1>Core Components</h1>
	  <h3><a href="/pacemaker.html">Pacemaker</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    At its core, Pacemaker is a distributed finite state
	    machine capable of co-ordinating the startup and recovery
	    of inter-related services across a set of machines.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Pacemaker understands many different resource types (OCF,
	    SYSV, systemd) and can accurately model the relationships
	    between them (collocation, ordering).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It can even use technology such
	    as <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> to
	    automatically isolate the resources managed by the
	    cluster.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3><a href="http://corosync.github.io/corosync/">Corosync</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    Corosync APIs provide membership (a list of peers),
	    messaging (the ability to talk to processes on those
	    peers), and quorum (do we have a majority) capabilities to
	    projects such as Apache Qpid and Pacemaker.
	  </p>

	  <h3><a href="http://clusterlabs.github.io/libqb/">libQB</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    libqb is a library with the primary purpose of providing
	    high performance client server reusable features. It
	    provides high performance logging, tracing, ipc, and poll.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The initial features of libqb come from the parts of
	    corosync that were thought to useful to other projects.
	  </p>

	  <h3><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/resource-agents/">Resource Agents</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    Resource agents are the abstraction that allows Pacemaker
	    to manage services it knows nothing about.  They contain
	    the logic for what to do when the cluster wishes to start,
	    stop or check the health of a service.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This particular set of agents conform to the Open Cluster
	    Framework (OCF) specification.

	    A <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/resource-agents/blob/master/doc/dev-guides/ra-dev-guide.txt">guide
	    to writing agents</a> is also available.
	  </p>

	  <h3><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/fence-agents/">Fence Agents</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    Fence agents are the abstraction that allows Pacemaker to
	    isolate badly behaving nodes.  They achieve this by either
	    powering off the node or disabling its access to the
	    network and/or shared storage.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Many types of network power switches exist and you will
	    want to choose the one(s) that match your hardware.
	    Please be aware that some (ones that don't loose power
	    when the machine goes down) are better than others.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Agents are generally expected to expose OCF-compliant
	    metadata.
	  </p>

	  <h3><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/OCF-spec/">OCF specification</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    The original documentation that sparked a lot of this
	    work.  Mostly we only use the "RA" specification. Efforts
	    are underway to revive the process for updating and
	    modernizing the spec.
	  </p>

	  <h1>Configuration Tools</h1>
	  <p>
	    Pacemaker's internal configuration format is XML, which is
	    great for machines but terrible for humans.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The community's best minds have created GUIs and Shells to
	    hide the XML and allow the configuration to be viewed and
	    updated in a more human friendly format.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Command Line Interfaces (Shells)</h2>
	  <h3><a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/crmsh/">crmsh</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    The original configuration shell for Pacemaker. Written
	    and maintained by SUSE, it may be used either as an
	    interactive shell with tab completion, for single commands
	    directly on the shell's command line or as batch mode
	    scripting tool.
	  </p>
	  <h3><a href="https://github.com/feist/pcs">pcs</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    An alternate vision for a full cluster lifecycle
	    configuration shell and web based GUI. Handles everything
	    from cluster installation through to resource
	    configuration and status.
	  </p>

	  <h2>GUI Tools</h2>
	  <h3><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker-mgmt">pygui</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    The original GUI for Pacemaker written in Python by IBM
	    China.  Mostly deprecated on SLES in favor of Hawk
	  </p>
	  <h3><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk">hawk</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    Hawk is a web-based GUI for managing and monitoring
	    Pacemaker HA clusters. It is generally intended to be run
	    on every node in the cluster, so that you can just point
	    your web browser at any node to access it.  It is
	    documented as part of the
	    <a href="http://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/?page=/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/data/cha_ha_configuration_hawk.html">
	      SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability
	      Extension documentation</a>
	  </p>
	  <h3><a href="http://lcmc.sf.net">LCMC</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    The Linux Clusther Management Console (LCMC) is a GUI with
	    an inovative approach for representing the status of and
	    relationships between cluster services.  It uses SSH to
	    let you install, configure and manage clusters from your
	    desktop.
	  </p>
	  <h3><a href="https://github.com/feist/pcs">pcs</a></h3> 
	  <p>
	    An alternate vision for a full cluster lifecycle
	    configuration shell and web based GUI. Handles everything
	    from cluster installation through to resource
	    configuration and status.
	  </p>
	  <h1>Other Add-ons</h1>
	  <h3><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/booth">booth</a></h3>
	  <p>
	    The Booth cluster ticket manager extends Pacemaker to
	    support geographically distributed clustering.  It does
	    this by managing the granting and revoking of 'tickets'
	    which authorizes one of the cluster sites, potentially
	    located in geographically dispersed locations, to run
	    certain resources.
	  </p>

	    storage based death and watchdog based fencing
