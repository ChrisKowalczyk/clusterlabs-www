	  <h1>Configuration Tools</h1>
	  <p>
	    Pacemaker's internal configuration format is XML, which is
	    great for machines but terrible for humans.
	    
	    The community's best minds have created GUIs and Shells to
	    hide the XML and allow the configuration to be viewed and
	    updated in a more human friendly format.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Command Line Interfaces (Shells)</h2>
	  <p><a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/crmsh/">crmsh</a>
	    - The original configuration shell for Pacemaker. Written
	    and maintained by SUSE, it may be used either as an
	    interactive shell with tab completion, for single commands
	    directly on the shell's command line or as batch mode
	    scripting tool.
	  </p>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/feist/pcs">pcs</a> - An
	    alternate vision for a full cluster lifecycle
	    configuration shell and web based GUI. Handles everything
	    from cluster installation through to resource
	    configuration and status.</p>

	  <h2>GUI Tools</h2>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker-mgmt">pygui</a>
	    - The original GUI for Pacemaker written in Python by IBM
	    China.  Mostly deprecated on SLES in favor of Hawk</p>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk">hawk</a> -
	    Hawk is a web-based GUI for managing and monitoring
	    Pacemaker HA clusters. It is generally intended to be run
	    on every node in the cluster, so that you can just point
	    your web browser at any node to access it.  It is
	    documented as part of the
	    <a href="http://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/?page=/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/data/cha_ha_configuration_hawk.html">
	      SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability
	      Extension documentation</a></p>
	  <p><a href="http://lcmc.sf.net">LCMC</a> - The Linux Cluster
	    Management Console (LCMC) is a GUI with an inovative
	    approach for representing the status of and relationships
	    between cluster services.  It uses SSH to let you install,
	    configure and manage clusters from your desktop.</p>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/feist/pcs">pcs</a> - An
	    alternate vision for a full cluster lifecycle
	    configuration shell and web based GUI. Handles everything
	    from cluster installation through to resource
	    configuration and status.</p>

	  <h1>Other Add-ons</h1>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/booth">booth</a>
	    - The Booth cluster ticket manager extends Pacemaker to
	    support geographically distributed clustering.  It does
	    this by managing the granting and revoking of 'tickets'
	    which authorizes one of the cluster sites, potentially
	    located in geographically dispersed locations, to run
	    certain resources.
